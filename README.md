# Greenhouse
It was my first experience in IOT and my first real projects that I built from scratch. Greenhouse is an IOT based on making a tomato greenhouse smart using sensors of light , humidity and temperature and actuator of engines .
My role in this project is based on programming a platform where we can control our farm and see all information about it. This work was planned to be done in one month but due to covid who I hit, I did it in 15 days but i didnt finish all .
The whole work was done by me from back-end to front-end and it was my first experience with many technologies such as javascript ,Ajax and php .
The platform contain four page : 
👉🏻 Home page which contain all the main information about the farm and ts owner , pictures , position in the maps (i didn't finish the coding )

👉🏻 Statistics page which contains all the information obtained by sensors with graphs to see how it acts.
